Different ways to set "global" state in React. Usage of a basic counter example (add, substract, add x amount).

The goal is to use the same pattern (visual and logical) to achieve the same results with the API given by each library.

Current state managers:

- [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) (Hooks)
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) (Unidirectional)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit) (Unidirectional)
- [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai) (Atomic)
- [Valtio](https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio) (Bidirectional)
